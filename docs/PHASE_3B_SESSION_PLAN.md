# Phase 3B Frontend Development - Multi-Session Plan

**Date**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Session 1
**Prerequisites**: Phase 3A (Backend Integration) âœ… COMPLETE

## Overview

Phase 3B implements the complete user interface on top of the working API foundation from Phase 3A. The work is split into 4 focused sessions to maintain context and ensure quality through iterative development.

**Total Estimated Duration**: 8-12 hours across 4 sessions
**Approach**: Backend-first (adapt UI to existing API rather than modifying backend)
**Quality Assurance**: Multi-agent collaboration with UX validation

  ```bash
  pnpm add react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers zod framer-motion
  ```
- [ ] Install core shadcn/ui components:
  ```bash
  npx shadcn-ui add button card input textarea label radio-group slider sheet dialog alert toast progress skeleton badge separator
  ```
- [ ] Verify all installations and check for conflicts

### Phase 1B: Asset Migration & Design System (45 min)
- [ ] Examine all assets in `docs/images/Suggested-Assets/`
- [ ] Create `apps/web/public/assets/` directory structure
- [ ] Migrate appropriate assets (SVGs for icons, PNGs for illustrations)
- [ ] Create design tokens in Tailwind config based on UI mockups
- [ ] Set up component directory structure: `apps/web/components/`

### Phase 1C: Authentication Foundation (60 min)
- [ ] Create authentication components:
  - [ ] `MagicLinkForm` - email input and send link functionality
  - [ ] `AuthProvider` - session management wrapper component
  - [ ] `UserProfile` - display user info and logout
- [ ] Implement protected route logic
- [ ] Add authentication state management with React Query
- [ ] Test magic link flow end-to-end

### Phase 1D: Layout & Navigation (45 min)
- [ ] Create main layout component with header
- [ ] Add navigation structure (Home, Gallery, How It Works)
- [ ] Implement user profile dropdown with credit display
- [ ] Create responsive navigation for mobile
- [ ] Add credit balance component with real-time updates

### Phase 1E: Testing & Validation (30 min)
- [ ] Test authentication flow manually
- [ ] Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Check API integration for user profile and credits
- [ ] Document any issues or deviations from plan

### Session 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] User can authenticate with magic link
- [ ] Credit balance displays correctly
- [ ] Navigation works on desktop and mobile
- [ ] All components follow design system
- [ ] Foundation ready for Session 2 workspace development

- [ ] Create image preview and validation
- [ ] Implement parameter selection forms (complexity/line thickness)
- [ ] Build job creation and real-time polling system
- [ ] Create result preview and download functionality
- [ ] Add loading states and progress indicators

### Session 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete upload â†’ generate â†’ download workflow

- [ ] Implement subtle animations and micro-interactions
- [ ] Add touch-friendly interactions for mobile

### Session 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design matches UI mockups
- [ ] PDF export working with proper paper sizes
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling implemented
- [ ] Subtle animations enhance user experience
- [ ] Ready for quality validation

## Session 4: Multi-Agent Quality Validation (1-2 hours)

**Goal**: Validated, production-ready application
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

### Quality Assurance Process
- [ ] UX reviewer analysis using Playwright screenshots
- [ ] UI designer refinements based on feedback
- [ ] Performance optimization and loading improvements
- [ ] Final integration testing across all workflows

### Session 4 Success Criteria
- [ ] UX reviewer confirms excellent user experience
- [ ] UI designer validates design consistency
- [ ] Performance meets acceptable standards
- [ ] All user journeys tested and working
- [ ] Production deployment ready

## Technical Architecture

### Backend API Integration (Existing - Phase 3A)
```typescript
// Working API endpoints to integrate with:
POST /api/auth/magic-link     // Magic Link Auth
POST /api/upload             // Upload presigned URL
POST /api/jobs               // Create generation job
GET /api/jobs/[id]           // Job status polling
GET /api/credits             // User credits
POST /api/pdf/export         // PDF export
```

### Data Types (Use Exactly)
```typescript
type Complexity = 'simple' | 'standard' | 'detailed'
type LineThickness = 'thin' | 'medium' | 'thick'
type JobStatus = 'queued' | 'running' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'
```

### Design Direction
- **Visual Style**: Warm cream/beige backgrounds with pastel accents
- **Branding**: Playful robot mascot (Scribble Machine)
- **Animations**: Subtle floating elements and micro-interactions
- **Mobile-First**: Touch-friendly with sheet overlays

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
- **frontend-developer**: Primary implementation
- **ui-designer**: Visual design refinement
- **ux-reviewer**: Comprehensive UX analysis via Playwright

## Session Transition Protocol

### Between Sessions
1. **Document Progress**: Update session status and completed items
2. **Commit Changes**: Ensure all work is committed to git
3. **Update Work Log**: Add session summary entry
4. **Note Blockers**: Document any issues for next session

### Session Handoff
1. **Context Preservation**: Reference this document for session scope
2. **Status Check**: Verify previous session deliverables
3. **Environment Prep**: Ensure backend services running
4. **Begin Implementation**: Start with todo list updates

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
- **Context Loss**: Mitigated by focused session scope and documentation
- **API Integration**: Backend-first approach ensures compatibility
- **Mobile Complexity**: Dedicated session for responsive design
- **Quality Concerns**: Multi-agent validation catches issues early

### Contingency Plans
- **Session Overrun**: Break into smaller sub-sessions if needed
- **Technical Blockers**: Document and address in next session
- **Design Conflicts**: Prioritize backend compatibility over visual perfection
