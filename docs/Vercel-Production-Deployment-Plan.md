# Vercel Production Deployment Plan & Tracking

## Executive Summary
After analyzing the current development setup and failed Vercel deployment, we're implementing a comprehensive production deployment strategy that maintains clean separation between development and production environments while ensuring all features work correctly in production.

## Current State Analysis
- **Confirmed Issue**: Next.js build failing locally and on Vercel with timeout during optimization
- **Environment Configuration Mixed Up**: Development values copied directly to production in Vercel
- **Dev Bypass Feature Exposed**: Testing functionality accessible in production environment
- **Missing Vercel Configuration**: No `vercel.json` for proper deployment settings
- **Production Environment Variables Not Set**: URLs, NODE_ENV, and feature flags need production values

## Recommended Approach: Clean Production Deployment

### Phase 1: Environment Configuration & Build Optimization
1. **Create Production Environment Variables**
   - Set `NODE_ENV=production` for proper production behavior
   - Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` with Vercel deployment URL
   - Set up proper Supabase URLs for production database
   - Configure Stripe keys (test keys initially, can upgrade to live later)
   - Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` for worker functionality

2. **Build Configuration & Optimization**
   - Create `vercel.json` with proper build settings and timeouts
   - Fix local build issues (clear Next.js cache, optimize workspace dependencies)
   - Configure monorepo detection and build commands
   - Set proper memory limits and build timeout

### Phase 2: Development/Production Separation
3. **Secure Development Features**
   - Verify dev bypass feature automatically hidden in production (`NODE_ENV` checks)
   - Ensure all development-only features properly gated
   - Test environment-specific configurations work correctly

4. **Clean Vercel Project Setup**
   - Delete existing failed Vercel project via MCP
   - Create fresh Vercel project with proper configuration
   - Set up GitHub integration with correct repository

### Phase 3: Deployment & Verification
5. **Deploy via Vercel MCP**
   - Configure all environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Deploy and monitor build logs for success
   - Verify deployment URL and SSL certificate

6. **Post-deployment Testing**
   - Test authentication flow (ensure dev bypass is hidden)
   - Test image upload and generation workflow
   - Verify all environment-specific features work correctly
   - Test responsive design and mobile functionality

## MCP TOOLS UTILIZATION

### Vercel MCP
- **Primary Tool**: All Vercel project management, deployment, and configuration
- **Usage**: Delete/create projects, configure environment variables, deploy, monitor logs
- **Key Functions**: `deploy_to_vercel`, `list_projects`, `get_project`, `list_deployments`

### Supabase MCP
- **Usage**: Verify production database configuration and connectivity
- **Key Functions**: `get_project`, `list_tables`, `get_advisors` for security validation

### Context7 MCP
- **Usage**: Reference latest Vercel and Next.js documentation for configuration best practices
- **Key Functions**: `resolve-library-id`, `get-library-docs` for Vercel/Next.js guidance

### Playwright MCP
- **Usage**: End-to-end testing of deployed application functionality
- **Key Functions**: `browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_snapshot` for production testing

## BACKEND PRESERVATION NOTES
- **No API changes required** - existing job processing (`/api/jobs/*`) works perfectly
- **Maintain current auth/credit system** - no changes to user authentication or billing flows
- **Keep existing database schema** - all Job, Asset, User types remain unchanged
- **Preserve worker service** - background processing continues working as-is

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] **Clean production deployment** - successful build and deployment on Vercel
- [ ] **Development features hidden** - dev bypass and testing tools not accessible in production
- [ ] **Full functionality working** - upload, generation, and download workflows operational
- [ ] **Proper environment separation** - development and production configurations distinct
- [ ] **Performance optimized** - fast build times and responsive application

## ROLLBACK PLAN
If issues arise during deployment:
1. Keep existing development environment functional and unchanged
2. Use Vercel MCP to quickly rollback to previous deployment if needed
3. All code changes are minimal and easily reversible
4. Development workflow remains unaffected during production deployment
