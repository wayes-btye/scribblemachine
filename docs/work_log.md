### [2025-09-19T19:00:00Z] — Session Summary
**Focus:** Test quality of both edge detection and Gemini image generation approaches
**Done:**
- Fixed Gemini API integration and tested with billing enabled
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Image generates excellent quality coloring pages (6-12s generation)
- Edge detection results are completely unusable (blank PNGs, broken lines)
**Next:**
- Remove edge detection from fallback strategy
- Focus on Gemini API reliability and error handling
- Implement user-facing generation with proper loading states
**Decisions:**
- Edge detection NOT suitable even as fallback - better to show nothing
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is the primary and only generation method
- Need robust error handling when API fails rather than fallback generation

### [2025-09-19T18:30:00Z] — Session Summary
**Focus:** Fix API integration issues and validate correct Gemini image generation model
**Done:**

- Discovered we were using wrong API: Gemini 1.5 Flash (analysis) vs 2.5 Flash Image (generation)
- Created proper Gemini 2.5 Flash Image test script with correct model (nano-banana)
**Next:**
- Set up billing for Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to test actual generation
- Implement hybrid approach: AI generation primary, edge detection fallback
**Decisions:**
- Use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview ($0.039/image) for actual line-art generation
- Keep edge detection as immediate fallback for quota limits or API failures
- Remove edge detection from fallback strategy
- Focus on Gemini API reliability and error handling
- Implement user-facing generation with proper loading states
**Decisions:**
- Edge detection NOT suitable even as fallback - better to show nothing

- Created comprehensive image-to-line-art test suite with 3 test scripts
- Implemented edge detection fallback with 5 different algorithms for coloring pages
**Next:**
- Run image tests with actual photos once user adds test images
- Begin Phase 2: Foundation & Infrastructure (Supabase setup)
**Decisions:**
- Edge detection as primary fallback since Gemini 1.5 doesn't generate images
- Multiple test methods provide flexibility for different age groups and complexity levels

### [2025-09-20T13:00:00Z] — Session Summary
**Focus:** Phase 3A Backend Integration - API to Worker Connection
**Done:**
- Connected POST /api/jobs endpoint to worker processing system
- Updated worker service to use Phase 2 database schema with credit handling
- Created simple polling worker to bypass pg-boss PostgreSQL connection issues
**Next:**
- Begin Phase 3B: Frontend Development (UI components and user experience)
- Deploy both services for production testing
- Create proper pg-boss setup for production (may require Supabase pooler configuration)
**Decisions:**
- Used database polling approach instead of pg-boss for MVP due to Supabase external connection limitations

- API creates jobs with 'queued' status for worker pickup
**Notes:**
- Worker successfully initializes and polls for jobs every 5 seconds
- Credit increment function added to database for safe credit operations
