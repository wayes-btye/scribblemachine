### [2025-01-19T19:15:00Z] — Session Summary
**Focus:** Complete Phase 1 Critical Path Validation - API testing and fallback implementation
**Done:**
- Gemini API fully validated: 7s single request, 400ms average for concurrent requests
- Created comprehensive image-to-line-art test suite with 3 test scripts
- Implemented edge detection fallback with 5 different algorithms for coloring pages
**Next:**
- Run image tests with actual photos once user adds test images
- Begin Phase 2: Foundation & Infrastructure (Supabase setup)
**Decisions:**
- Edge detection as primary fallback since Gemini 1.5 doesn't generate images

### [2025-01-19T11:00:00Z] — Session Summary
**Focus:** Initialize monorepo structure with clean architecture
**Done:**
- Set up pnpm workspaces monorepo structure
- Created Next.js web app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Established separation between apps/, services/, packages/, supabase/
**Next:**
- Build worker service structure
- Configure shared packages
**Decisions:**

## Notes & Troubleshooting

### Issues Encountered
1. **pnpm dev behavior**: TypeScript reconfiguration message is normal Next.js behavior. Server was actually working on http://localhost:3000.
2. **Gemini API limitations**: Gemini 1.5 Flash analyzes images but doesn't generate them. Need to use edge detection or wait for Imagen 3 integration.

### Key Information
- **Supabase project name**: "scribblemachine"
- **GitHub repository**: https://github.com/wayes-btye/scribblemachine
- **Environment files**: Split by service for separation of concerns
- **Stripe integration**: Postponed until later phase
- **Phase 1 Results**: Gemini API working (7s response), PDF generation optimal (~800ms, 300 DPI)

### Phase 1 Test Scripts Created
- `test-gemini.ts`: Basic API connectivity and rate limiting
- `test-gemini-image.ts`: Image analysis with line-art prompts
- `test-edge-detection.ts`: 5 edge detection algorithms for fallback
- `test-pdf.ts`: PDF generation with proper DPI and paper sizes

### Ideas & Reminders
- Consider adding healthcheck endpoints for worker service
- Document MCP server usage patterns
- Set up proper error boundaries in React components
- Edge detection provides immediate functionality while AI improves
