## Notes & Troubleshooting

### Issues Encountered
1. **pnpm dev behavior**: TypeScript reconfiguration message is normal Next.js behavior. Server was actually working on http://localhost:3000.

### Key Information
- **Supabase project name**: "scribblemachine"
- **GitHub repository**: https://github.com/wayes-btye/scribblemachine
- **Environment files**: Split by service for separation of concerns
- **Stripe integration**: Postponed until later phase

### Ideas & Reminders
- Consider adding healthcheck endpoints for worker service
- Document MCP server usage patterns
- Set up proper error boundaries in React components
