- Updated all worker services (simple-worker.ts, generate/index.ts, test-generation-worker.ts) to use correct storage bucket
- Tested UI functionality via Playwright MCP (landing page, authentication dialog working correctly)
- Confirmed both web app (port 3000) and worker services are running properly
**Next:**
- Testing blocked: Cannot bypass authentication to test actual upload→generate→download workflow
- Authentication token bypass method needed for comprehensive testing
- Consider implementing test session injection or admin bypass for testing purposes
**Decisions:**
- Storage path mismatch issue resolved - workers now access files from correct 'originals' bucket
- UI testing successful but limited to unauthenticated pages due to magic link authentication requirement
- Need authentication bypass strategy before claiming "complete workflow testing" success

### [2025-09-21T15:15:00Z] — Task/Event
**Context:** User reported continued 'Invalid job data received' error with worker failing on 'Bucket not found' for edge map upload

**What changed:**
- Fixed edge map storage path format in simple-worker.ts: 'intermediates/user/job/edge.png' → 'user/job/edge.png'
- Fixed path format in generate/index.ts: removed bucket name prefix from storage path
- Fixed path format in workers/generation-worker.ts: corrected storage path format
- Issue was bucket name being included in path when .from('intermediates') already specifies bucket
**Leftover:**
- Ready for user testing - storage path format should now match Supabase expectations
- Worker shows successful Gemini generation, path fix should resolve 400 upload errors


### [2025-09-21T15:30:00Z] — Task/Event
**Context:** Fixed job polling API response format mismatch causing premature 'Invalid job data' errors
**What changed:**
- Fixed API response structure in jobs/[id]/route.ts: 'params' → 'params_json' to match component expectations
- Issue was frontend component polling job status and receiving malformed response before Gemini completed
- Storage upload now working (POST 200 status in latest logs) but frontend polling broken due to data format mismatch
**Leftover:**
- Frontend should now properly display job progress during Gemini processing
