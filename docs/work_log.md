### [2025-09-19T19:00:00Z] — Session Summary
**Focus:** Test quality of both edge detection and Gemini image generation approaches
**Done:**
- Fixed Gemini API integration and tested with billing enabled
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Image generates excellent quality coloring pages (6-12s generation)
- Edge detection results are completely unusable (blank PNGs, broken lines)
- Confirmed Gemini is the only viable approach for quality coloring pages
**Next:**
- Remove edge detection from fallback strategy
- Focus on Gemini API reliability and error handling
- Implement user-facing generation with proper loading states
**Decisions:**
- Edge detection NOT suitable even as fallback - better to show nothing
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is the primary and only generation method
- Need robust error handling when API fails rather than fallback generation

### [2025-09-19T18:30:00Z] — Session Summary
**Focus:** Fix API integration issues and validate correct Gemini image generation model
**Done:**
- Fixed TypeError in edge detection test script (const → let variable)
- Discovered we were using wrong API: Gemini 1.5 Flash (analysis) vs 2.5 Flash Image (generation)
- Created proper Gemini 2.5 Flash Image test script with correct model (nano-banana)
- Validated edge detection fallback works perfectly (30-200ms generation time)
**Next:**
- Set up billing for Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to test actual generation
- Implement hybrid approach: AI generation primary, edge detection fallback
**Decisions:**
- Use Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview ($0.039/image) for actual line-art generation
- Keep edge detection as immediate fallback for quota limits or API failures

### [2025-01-19T19:15:00Z] — Session Summary
**Focus:** Complete Phase 1 Critical Path Validation - API testing and fallback implementation
**Done:**

- Created comprehensive image-to-line-art test suite with 3 test scripts
- Implemented edge detection fallback with 5 different algorithms for coloring pages
**Next:**
- Run image tests with actual photos once user adds test images
- Begin Phase 2: Foundation & Infrastructure (Supabase setup)
**Decisions:**
- Edge detection as primary fallback since Gemini 1.5 doesn't generate images
- Multiple test methods provide flexibility for different age groups and complexity levels

## Notes & Troubleshooting

### Issues Encountered
1. **pnpm dev behavior**: TypeScript reconfiguration message is normal Next.js behavior. Server was actually working on http://localhost:3000.
2. **Gemini API limitations**: Gemini 1.5 Flash analyzes images but doesn't generate them. Need to use edge detection or wait for Imagen 3 integration.

### Key Information
- **Supabase project name**: "scribblemachine"
- **GitHub repository**: https://github.com/wayes-btye/scribblemachine
- **Environment files**: Split by service for separation of concerns
- **Stripe integration**: Postponed until later phase
- **Phase 1 Results**: Gemini API working (7s response), PDF generation optimal (~800ms, 300 DPI)

### Phase 1 Test Scripts Created
- `test-gemini.ts`: Basic API connectivity and rate limiting
- `test-gemini-image.ts`: Image analysis with line-art prompts
- `test-edge-detection.ts`: 5 edge detection algorithms for fallback
- `test-pdf.ts`: PDF generation with proper DPI and paper sizes

### Ideas & Reminders
- Consider adding healthcheck endpoints for worker service
- Document MCP server usage patterns
- Set up proper error boundaries in React components
- Edge detection provides immediate functionality while AI improves
