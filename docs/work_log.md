# Work Log & Development Scratchpad

This file serves as a development scratchpad for tracking progress, notes, and debugging information.

## Current Session - 2024-01-19

###  Completed Today
- Set up complete monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
- Created Next.js web app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Built worker service structure for background processing
- Configured shared packages (types, database, config)
- Set up Supabase migrations and database schema
- Created environment variable templates
- Established CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions
- Updated documentation structure

### =' Current Task
Setting up GitHub repository and cleaning up project structure

### = Issues Encountered
1. **pnpm dev getting stuck**: When running `pnpm dev`, TypeScript reconfiguration happened automatically, then showed "ready in 3.4 seconds". This is normal Next.js behavior - it was actually working and serving the app on http://localhost:3000.

### =Ý Notes
- Supabase project name: "scribblemachine"
- Using pnpm workspaces for monorepo management
- Environment files are split by service for separation of concerns
- Stripe integration postponed until later phase

### <¯ Next Steps
- [ ] Initialize git repository and push to GitHub
- [ ] Clean up unnecessary files and folders
- [ ] Begin Phase 1: Gemini API and PDF validation testing

### =­ Ideas & Reminders
- Consider adding healthcheck endpoints for worker service
- Document MCP server usage patterns
- Set up proper error boundaries in React components
