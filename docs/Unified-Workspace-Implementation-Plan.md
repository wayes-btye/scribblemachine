# Unified Workspace Implementation Plan & Tracking

## Executive Summary
After analyzing both workflow UI plans (Codex and Cursor) and the current codebase, we're implementing **Option A: Unified Workspace with Mode Toggle** enhanced with comprehensive loading animations and context-preserving features.

## Current State Analysis
- **Confirmed Issue**: Both `/create` and `/imagine` pages use nearly identical layouts with duplicated state management
- **Panel Churn Problem**: Each step (upload → params → progress → result) renders new Cards sequentially, creating jarring transitions
- **Context Loss During Edits**: `GenerationProgress` completely replaces `ResultPreview`, losing visual context
- **Basic Loading States**: Simple `Progress` bars don't match family-friendly brand

## Recommended Approach: Unified Workspace Architecture

### Phase 1: Unified Route & State Management
1. **Create New Unified Workspace** (`/workspace` or consolidate to `/create`)
   - Single page with shared state for both upload and prompt modes
   - Mode toggle at the top (Upload Photo | Imagine Idea)
   - Preserve existing backend job processing - no API changes needed

2. **State Consolidation**
   ```typescript
   interface WorkspaceState {
     mode: 'upload' | 'prompt' | null
     step: 'input' | 'generating' | 'result' | 'editing'
     data: {
       uploadedImage?: { assetId: string, url: string }
       textPrompt?: string
       parameters?: GenerationParameters
       currentJob?: Job
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Progressive Disclosure Layout**
   - Left pane: Mode toggle + dynamic form (FileUploader OR TextPromptForm)
   - Right pane: Context canvas that adapts to current step
   - Smooth transitions between states instead of card mounting/unmounting

### Phase 2: Enhanced Loading Experience
4. **Lottie Animation Integration**
   - Replace basic `Progress` bars with family-friendly Lottie animations
   - Install `lottie-react` and create `LoadingAnimation` component
   - Themes: magic wand (generation), image processing (upload), pencil (editing)

5. **Context-Preserving Edit Flow**
   - Keep original preview visible with overlay loading during edits
   - Show "Applying changes..." with animation over dimmed preview
   - Eliminate complete preview disappearance

### Phase 3: Responsive Optimization
6. **Mobile-First Responsive Design**
   - Collapsible sections with sticky mode toggle
   - Touch-friendly interactions
   - Swipe gestures for mode switching

- [ ] **Family-friendly loading** - playful animations that match brand while maintaining professionalism

## ROLLBACK PLAN
If issues arise during implementation:
1. Keep existing `/create` and `/imagine` routes functional during development
2. Use feature flags or route-based rollback to revert to old system
3. All existing components remain backward compatible
4. Database and API remain unchanged, ensuring easy rollback
