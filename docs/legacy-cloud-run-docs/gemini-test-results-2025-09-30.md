# Gemini API Latency Test Results - September 30, 2025

## üéØ Test Objective

Determine whether Cloud Run environment is causing Gemini API slowness.

**Hypothesis:** Job fb81ea57 took 544 seconds because Cloud Run environment has network issues with Gemini API.

**Test Method:** Run IDENTICAL Gemini API call locally and on Cloud Run, compare results.

## üìä Test Results

### Local Environment Test
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-30 10:41:01 UTC
**Environment:** Local Windows machine
**Script:** `services/worker/src/cloud-run-gemini-test.ts`

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "duration": 4997,
  "durationSeconds": "5.00",
  "imageGenerated": true,
  "slowdownFactor": "1.0",
  "environment": "local",
  "region": "unknown"
}
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ **5.00 seconds** - GOOD

---

### Cloud Run Environment Test
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-30 10:41:15 UTC (14 seconds later)
**Environment:** Cloud Run (europe-west1)
**Service:** gemini-latency-test
**Script:** SAME `services/worker/src/cloud-run-gemini-test.ts` (deployed)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "duration": 5150,
  "durationSeconds": "5.15",
  "imageGenerated": true,
  "slowdownFactor": "1.0",
  "environment": "gemini-latency-test",
  "region": "unknown"
}
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ **5.15 seconds** - GOOD

## üîç Analysis

### Direct Comparison

| Metric | Local | Cloud Run | Difference |
|--------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Duration | 5.00s | 5.15s | +0.15s (+3%) |
| Success | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | Same |
| Image Generated | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | Same |
| Status | GOOD | GOOD | Same |

### Key Findings

**1. Cloud Run Environment Is NOT The Problem** ‚úÖ
- Cloud Run test ran in 5.15 seconds
- Local test ran in 5.00 seconds
- Difference is negligible (0.15s / 3%)
- Both well within "GOOD" threshold (<10s)

**2. Gemini API Works Fine From Cloud Run** ‚úÖ
- Same model: `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`
- Same API call: Text-to-image generation
- Same result: Image generated successfully
- No network throttling observed
- No regional routing issues

**3. Production Job fb81ea57 Slowness Is NOT Environment-Related** ‚ùå
- Job fb81ea57: 544 seconds (9 minutes)
- Standalone test: 5.15 seconds
- **Slowdown: 105x for production, but NOT in isolated test**

## üö® Revised Conclusions

### What We Proved
- ‚úÖ Cloud Run ‚Üí Gemini API: **FAST** (5.15s)
- ‚úÖ Local ‚Üí Gemini API: **FAST** (5.00s)
- ‚úÖ Network is not throttling Gemini API calls
- ‚úÖ Regional routing (EU Cloud Run ‚Üí Gemini) is fine

### What This Means
**The 544-second slowdown in production is NOT caused by:**
1. ‚ùå Cloud Run environment
2. ‚ùå Gemini API throttling
3. ‚ùå Regional routing issues
4. ‚ùå Network configuration

**The slowdown MUST be caused by:**
1. üîç Race conditions (multiple instances processing same job)
2. üîç Database contention (polling/locking issues)
3. üîç Resource starvation (CPU/memory limits)
4. üîç Worker implementation issues (retries, timeouts, etc.)

## üéØ Next Steps - REVISED Investigation

### Priority 1: Investigate Worker Implementation
**Check:** `services/worker/src/simple-worker.ts`
- Job polling logic
- Retry mechanisms
- Timeout handling
- Error recovery

**Questions:**
- Are jobs being retried multiple times?
- Is the worker waiting for something?
- Are there blocking operations?

### Priority 2: Deploy Production Monitoring
**Action:** Push the Gemini API timing logs to production
```bash
git add services/worker/src/services/gemini-service.ts
git commit -m "feat(worker): add Gemini API latency monitoring"
git push origin main
```

**Why:** See ACTUAL Gemini API duration in production jobs
- If logs show 5s ‚Üí Problem is NOT Gemini API
- If logs show 540s ‚Üí Problem IS Gemini API (contradicts our test)

### Priority 3: Check Race Conditions (Again)
**Evidence:** Job d92ce920 had 9 concurrent processing attempts

**Action:** Verify single-instance configuration is working
```bash
gcloud run services describe scribblemachine-worker --region europe-west1 --format="value(spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources.limits,spec.template.metadata.annotations)"
```

**Look for:**
- min-instances: 1
- max-instances: 1
- concurrency: 1

### Priority 4: Database Query Analysis
**Check:** How long does job polling take?

**Add timing logs:**
```typescript
const startPoll = Date.now();
const jobs = await boss.fetch(['ingest', 'generate', 'pdf']);
console.log(`‚è±Ô∏è [DB] Polling took ${Date.now() - startPoll}ms`);
```

## üìù Why Was Job fb81ea57 Slow Then?

### Evidence Timeline (from previous analysis)
```
10:01:38 - Job started processing
10:10:42 - Job completed (544 seconds later)
```

**Gemini API call timing (estimated from logs):**
- Job started: 10:01:38
- Asset fetch: ~300ms
- Preprocessing: ~200ms
- Gemini API started: ~10:01:39
- Gemini API ended: ~10:10:41 (540s later)
- Upload: ~400ms
- Job done: 10:10:42

**Our isolated test shows Gemini API takes 5s, NOT 540s.**

### Possible Explanations

**Theory 1: Worker Retry Logic**
- Worker retries Gemini API calls on failure
- First attempt fails/times out
- Retries with exponential backoff
- Total time: Original attempt + retries = 540s

**Theory 2: Database Locking**
- Job gets picked up
- Worker waits for database lock
- Other workers are holding locks
- Eventually processes after 540s wait

**Theory 3: Resource Starvation**
- Cloud Run instance is CPU/memory starved
- Gemini API call is made but response processing is delayed
- Instance is throttled or swapping

**Theory 4: Test Environment Difference**
- Standalone test service has different configuration
- Production worker has additional overhead
- Something in worker code is blocking

## üî¨ How To Confirm

### Test 1: Deploy Production Monitoring
**See actual Gemini API timing in production jobs**

Expected outcome:
- If logs show ~5s ‚Üí Confirms problem is NOT Gemini API
- If logs show ~540s ‚Üí Contradicts our standalone test (investigate why)

### Test 2: Check Worker Retry Logic
**Review:** `services/worker/src/services/gemini-service.ts`

Look for:
```typescript
maxRetries: number
retryDelayMs: number
```

Calculate max retry time:
- 1st attempt: fails at timeout
- Retry 1: wait + attempt
- Retry 2: wait + attempt
- Total: Could be 500s+ if timeouts are long

### Test 3: Profile Entire Job
**Add timing logs to EVERY step:**
```typescript
‚è±Ô∏è [Job] Start
‚è±Ô∏è [DB] Fetch assets: XXXms
‚è±Ô∏è [Sharp] Preprocess: XXXms
‚è±Ô∏è [Gemini API] Generate: XXXms
‚è±Ô∏è [Storage] Upload: XXXms
‚è±Ô∏è [Job] Total: XXXms
```

This will show EXACTLY where 540s is spent.

## üí° Key Takeaways

1. **Cloud Run is NOT slow** - Gemini API works fine from Cloud Run (5.15s)
2. **Production slowness has different cause** - Need to investigate worker implementation
3. **Priority shifted** - Focus on worker code, NOT environment
4. **Next action** - Deploy production monitoring to see real timing

**Bottom line:** The standalone test proves Cloud Run environment is fine. The production slowness must be in the worker implementation, database, or configuration.
