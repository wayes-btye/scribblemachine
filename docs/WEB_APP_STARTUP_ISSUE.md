# Web App Startup Issue - Context for Fresh Session

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: Next.js web app hangs during startup and doesn't respond to HTTP requests
**Status**: BLOCKING Session 2 implementation
**When**: After switching worker service from pg-boss to polling approach

## Environment Details
- **Platform**: Windows (MINGW64_NT-10.0-19045)
- **Node Version**: Multiple Node.js processes running (potential conflict)
- **Project**: MonoRepo with pnpm workspaces
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router

## Symptoms
1. Next.js starts up and shows "Local: http://localhost:3000" (or 3001, 3002, 3003)
2. No compilation output appears (normally shows "Compiled / in 6s")
3. HTTP requests timeout (curl hangs, Playwright navigation times out)
4. Process appears to be running but not responsive

## What Works
- ✅ Worker service starts successfully (polling every 5 seconds)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ No obvious compilation errors in code
- ✅ Environment variables load correctly (.env.local)

## Attempts Made
1. **Port conflicts**: App tries 3000 → 3001 → 3002 → 3003 (normal behavior)
2. **Individual startup**: Started web app alone (`cd apps/web && npm run dev`)
3. **Background processes**: Killed previous sessions, still hangs
4. **Timeout tests**: curl --connect-timeout 5 times out
5. **Multiple Node processes**: 50+ node.exe processes running (potential resource conflict)

## Technical Context
- **Last working state**: Session 1 complete with auth flow working
- **Recent changes**:
  - Changed `services/worker/package.json` dev script from `src/index.ts` to `src/simple-worker.ts`
  - No other code changes since last working state
- **Project structure**: MonoRepo with workspace dependencies

## Environment Files Status
- `apps/web/.env.local`: Present with Supabase credentials
- `services/worker/.env`: Present with correct configuration
- No environment variable errors in logs

## Next Steps for Fresh Session
1. **Process cleanup**: Kill all Node.js processes and restart clean
2. **Port investigation**: Check what's using ports 3000-3003
3. **Dependency check**: Verify workspace dependencies are properly linked
4. **Individual service testing**: Start web app in isolation
5. **Build check**: Try production build to isolate dev-specific issues

## Success Criteria
- Web app starts and responds to HTTP requests
- Can navigate to homepage in browser/Playwright
- Ready to implement Session 2: Core Workspace features

## Related Files Modified
- `services/worker/package.json` (dev script change)
- `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` (updated for Session 2 prep)
- `docs/PHASE_3B_SESSION_PLAN.md` (marked Session 1 complete)
- `docs/work_log.md` (session summary added)

## Worker Service Status
✅ **WORKING**: Polling-based worker successfully starts and polls for jobs every 5 seconds. No pg-boss PostgreSQL connection errors.

This startup issue is environment-related, not code-related. A fresh session with process cleanup should resolve it.
