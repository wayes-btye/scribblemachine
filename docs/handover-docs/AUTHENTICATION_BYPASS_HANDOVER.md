# Authentication Bypass Challenge - Handover Document

**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Session**: Initial Implementation Session
**Status**: CRITICAL BLOCKER - Authentication bypass not achieved
**Next Assignee**: Fresh AI agent with specialized authentication expertise

## üéØ The Goal

**Primary Objective**: Enable AI agents to programmatically bypass magic link authentication and access protected routes in the Coloring Page Generator app for automated testing.

**Why This Matters**: Without authentication bypass, AI agents cannot test the core user workflows (upload, generate, download) that represent 90% of the app's functionality.

**Success Definition**: AI agent can execute `node playwright-staging.js stage1` and successfully reach an authenticated state where they can access `/create` and upload files.

## üìã Current State

### ‚úÖ What Works
- **Test User Created**: `playwright-test@example.com` exists in Supabase with 10 credits
- **Database Setup**: Full user setup via Supabase MCP (auth.users + public.users + credits)
- **Playwright MCP**: Navigation, screenshot capture, UI interaction all functional
- **Test Infrastructure**: Scripts and staging framework ready
- **Magic Link UI**: Successfully captured screenshots of authentication flow

### ‚ùå Critical Blocker
**CANNOT BYPASS AUTHENTICATION** - All attempts to programmatically authenticate have failed.

## üîç What We've Tried (All Failed)

### 1. Mock Session Token Injection
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('sb-htxsylxwvcbrazdowjys-auth-token', mockSessionData);
```
**Result**: ‚ùå Token injected but app doesn't recognize it as valid

### 2. Manual JWT Signing
```javascript
// Used service role key as JWT secret
const jwt = sign(payload, SERVICE_ROLE_KEY);
```
**Result**: ‚ùå App rejects manually signed tokens

### 3. URL Parameter Authentication
```
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback?access_token=...&refresh_token=...
```
**Result**: ‚ùå Redirects back to home page, ignores URL parameters

### 4. Supabase Admin API
```bash
curl -X POST ".../auth/v1/admin/generate_link" -H "Authorization: Bearer ..."
```
**Result**: ‚ùå "Invalid API key" - service role key rejected

### 5. Direct Route Access
```
http://localhost:3000/create
```
**Result**: ‚ùå Redirects to home page (protected route)

## üîß Available Tools & Assets

### Supabase Access
- **Project ID**: `htxsylxwvcbrazdowjys`
- **Service Role Key**: Available in `apps/web/.env.local`
- **Anon Key**: Available via Supabase MCP
- **Database Access**: Full CRUD via Supabase MCP
- **Test User**: `playwright-test@example.com` / User ID: `b6dfbbb2-05f3-454c-9e89-2be2e7f8bd5e`

### Working Scripts
- **`setup-test-user.js`**: Creates test user and database setup
- **`generate-real-session.js`**: Attempts JWT generation (currently failing)
- **`playwright-staging.js`**: Stage 1 & 2 automation (blocked at auth)
- **`test-session-token.txt`**: Contains latest token attempts

### MCP Tools Available
- **Supabase MCP**: Database operations, user management, SQL execution
- **Playwright MCP**: Browser automation, screenshot capture, UI interaction
- **Context7 MCP**: Documentation lookup for Supabase/JWT/authentication

## üß† Key Insights & Learning

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Server-Side Validation**: App validates JWT tokens against Supabase's internal secret, not the service role key
2. **Magic Link Dependency**: App designed for magic link flow only, no backdoor authentication
3. **Session Management**: React auth provider checks tokens via API calls, not just localStorage
4. **Route Protection**: Server-side middleware blocks unauthenticated access to `/create`

### Technical Context
- **App**: Next.js 14 with Supabase Auth using magic links (`signInWithOtp`)
- **Auth Flow**: Email ‚Üí Magic link ‚Üí Token exchange ‚Üí Authenticated session
- **Session Storage**: `sb-htxsylxwvcbrazdowjys-auth-token` in localStorage
- **Protection**: Both client-side and server-side route protection

### What We Know About Supabase Auth
- Uses JWT tokens with HS256 algorithm
- Tokens must be signed with Supabase's internal JWT secret (not service role key)
- Issuer must be `https://htxsylxwvcbrazdowjys.supabase.co/auth/v1`
- Requires specific claims: `aud`, `role`, `sub`, `exp`, etc.

## üéØ Recommended Next Approaches

### Priority 1: Find Real JWT Secret
The service role key is NOT the JWT signing secret. Need to:
- Research Supabase documentation for JWT secret extraction
- Check if JWT secret is derivable from project settings
- Look for environment variables or API endpoints that expose the real secret

### Priority 2: Admin API Access
Current service role key doesn't work for admin endpoints:
- Verify service role key has admin permissions
- Try different authentication headers (apikey vs Authorization)
- Research proper admin API authentication flow

### Priority 3: Alternative Authentication Methods
- **Real Magic Link**: Automate actual email ‚Üí magic link ‚Üí token extraction
- **OAuth Flow**: Use GitHub/Google OAuth if enabled and bypass magic links
- **Test Mode**: Check if Supabase has testing/development authentication bypasses

### Priority 4: Reverse Engineering
- **Network Inspection**: Capture real authentication flow to see exact token format
- **Source Code**: Examine app's auth implementation for clues
- **Browser Debugging**: Use DevTools to understand exact auth flow

## üìö Useful Resources

### Documentation
- Supabase Auth API: https://supabase.com/docs/reference/api/auth
- JWT Token Format: Check Context7 MCP for `/supabase/auth` documentation
- Next.js Auth: Review app's auth implementation in `apps/web/lib/auth/`

### Files to Examine
- `apps/web/lib/auth/auth-provider.tsx` - Client-side auth logic
- `apps/web/app/auth/callback/route.ts` - Token exchange endpoint
- `apps/web/.env.local` - Environment variables and keys
- `supabase/` - Database schema and migrations

### Commands to Try
```bash
# Test different API endpoints
curl -H "apikey: ANON_KEY" https://htxsylxwvcbrazdowjys.supabase.co/auth/v1/settings

# Check user details
node -e "console.log(require('./test-session-token.txt'))"

# Validate JWT structure
node -e "const jwt = 'TOKEN'; console.log(JSON.parse(Buffer.from(jwt.split('.')[1], 'base64')))"
```

## üö® What NOT to Try (Already Failed)

1. **Mock tokens with fake data** - App validates server-side
2. **Service role key as JWT secret** - Wrong secret, tokens rejected
3. **URL parameter injection** - App doesn't accept tokens via URL
4. **Direct localStorage manipulation** - Insufficient without proper tokens
5. **Admin API with current keys** - Keys don't have admin access

## üí° Success Criteria

You've succeeded when:
1. ‚úÖ Can execute `node playwright-staging.js stage1`
2. ‚úÖ AI agent reaches authenticated state (no "Sign In" button visible)
3. ‚úÖ Can navigate to `http://localhost:3000/create` without redirect
4. ‚úÖ Can upload test image via Playwright MCP
5. ‚úÖ Fresh AI agent can repeat the process consistently

## ü§ù Handover Checklist

- [ ] Review this document thoroughly
- [ ] Understand the goal: programmatic authentication bypass
- [ ] Check current project state: test user exists, scripts ready
- [ ] Focus on JWT secret discovery or alternative auth methods
- [ ] Test any solution with Playwright MCP to verify it works
- [ ] Update `docs/TEST_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` with your findings

## üéØ The Challenge

**The core challenge is not about testing the app - it's about defeating authentication programmatically.** Once authentication is bypassed, the rest of the testing infrastructure is ready and functional.

**Priority**: Find a way to generate valid Supabase JWT tokens that the app will accept, OR find an alternative programmatic authentication method.

Good luck! üöÄ
