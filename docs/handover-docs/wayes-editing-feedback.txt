- can only go back 1 step, i cant keep going back through each verision of updates

CURRENT: Additional History Component:
- As soon as you press "show version" why does it appear on a new (history) component altogether, leaving the initial component still there.
- just seems like when it was implemented just chucked a new component in there without thinking too hard about how it should reasonably look
Options@
 1) leave the initial component there - but with only the current generated image and the history component is the one that allows scrolling leaving initial component static 
 2) "show verions" / "hide versions" toggles the initial component to dissappear/appear and opposingly the history component to appear disappear. 
 ... why is 2 components even a thing? whats the harm in showing the version by default.


CURRENT: The editing of the image only works on the most recent generated image,
1) Remove the editing option for the any version except the current generated version 
OR 
2) The editting should be allowed on whatever the image is on display at the time
	(then there might be complication for the original edit button) because you need to track the before an after potentially)

Tbh those two buttons original and edit 1 should be called before / after

I understand why the original and editing - only 2 versions are there so you can clearly see what was edited alongside the prompt
