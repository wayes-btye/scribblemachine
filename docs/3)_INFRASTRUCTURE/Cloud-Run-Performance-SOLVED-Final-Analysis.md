# Cloud Run Performance SOLVED - Final Analysis
## The Definitive Guide to What Was Wrong and What to Do Next

**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ **PROBLEM SOLVED**
**Root Cause:** CPU Throttling on Cloud Run
**Solution Applied:** Disabled CPU throttling with `--no-cpu-throttling` flag

---

## üéâ BREAKTHROUGH: Problem Solved!

### The Results

**BEFORE (CPU Throttling Enabled - Default):**
- Job 669592dd: **346 seconds** (5 minutes 46 seconds)
- Gemini API: **213.5 seconds** (should be 5s)
- PDF Generation: **73.6 seconds** (should be 1-3s)
- Database operations: **8-13 seconds each**

**AFTER (CPU Throttling Disabled - `--no-cpu-throttling`):**
- Job 07d62d9b: **6.0 seconds total** ‚úÖ
- Gemini API: **4.8 seconds** ‚úÖ
- PDF Generation: **131ms** ‚úÖ
- Database operations: **65-75ms each** ‚úÖ

**Performance Improvement: 58x FASTER** (346s ‚Üí 6s)

### What Fixed It

One simple command:
```bash
gcloud run services update scribblemachine-worker \
  --region=europe-west1 \
  --no-cpu-throttling \
  --cpu-boost
```

This changed the CPU allocation from **request-based** (throttled during background tasks) to **always-on** (full CPU access even during polling).

### Investigation Phase (September 29-30, 2025)

1. **Initial Observation:** Jobs taking 5-9 minutes instead of 10-15 seconds
2. **Hypothesis 1:** Gemini API latency from Cloud Run
3. **Test 1:** Standalone Gemini test on Cloud Run ‚Üí **5.15s** (FAST!)
4. **Test 2:** Standalone Gemini test locally ‚Üí **5.00s** (FAST!)
5. **Confusion:** If standalone is fast, why is production 40x slower?
6. **Deep Research:** Discovered Cloud Run CPU throttling behavior
7. **Theory:** Request-based billing throttles CPU during background polling

## üß† Why CPU Throttling Was The Problem

### Cloud Run's Default Behavior (Request-Based Billing)

**Design Philosophy:**
- Cloud Run optimizes for **short-lived HTTP request/response** workloads
- Default billing: Pay only when **actively processing HTTP requests**
- To save costs, CPU is **throttled to near-zero** when not in a request

**What This Means for Polling Workers:**

1. **Worker polls database** ‚Üí Not an HTTP request ‚Üí **CPU throttled**
2. **Job found, processing starts** ‚Üí Still not an HTTP request ‚Üí **CPU still throttled**
3. **Gemini API call made** ‚Üí Async I/O over throttled CPU ‚Üí **Extremely slow**
4. **Response processing** ‚Üí Throttled CPU struggles ‚Üí **Everything molasses-slow**
5. **Database writes** ‚Üí Throttled CPU ‚Üí **10-20x slower than normal**

**The Kicker:**
Your standalone test worked BECAUSE it was triggered by an HTTP request (`curl /test`), which gave it full CPU access during processing. Your production worker had NO HTTP request context, so it ran with throttled CPU the entire time.

### Why This Wasn't Obvious

**Misleading Factors:**
- ‚ùå Standalone test was fast (different execution context)
- ‚ùå No error messages (everything "worked", just slowly)
- ‚ùå Resource metrics looked fine (CPU/memory usage was normal)
- ‚ùå Google's docs don't prominently warn about this for polling patterns

**The Smoking Gun:**
When we checked `gcloud run services describe`, there was **NO** `run.googleapis.com/cpu-throttling: false` annotation. This meant the default (throttled) behavior was active.

## üìä Current Architecture Assessment

### What You Have Now

**Architecture Type:** Simple Polling Worker (ADR-001, ADR-002)

**Implementation:**
- `simple-worker.ts` polls `jobs` table every 5 seconds
- Direct database access (no pg-boss queue system)
- Sequential job processing (one at a time)
- All-in-one worker (upload ‚Üí process ‚Üí generate ‚Üí store)

**Current Configuration:**
```yaml
Service: scribblemachine-worker
Region: europe-west1
CPU: 2 vCPU (always-on, no throttling) ‚úÖ
Memory: 2Gi
Concurrency: 1
Min Instances: 1
Max Instances: 1
CPU Boost: Enabled ‚úÖ
```

### Is This Scalable?

**Short Answer:** YES for your current scale, NO for high growth.

**Current Capacity (With Fix Applied):**
- **Job processing time:** 6-10 seconds per job
- **Throughput:** ~360-600 jobs/hour (single worker)
- **Cost:** ~$25-35/month (always-on instance)

**Breaking Points:**

| Jobs/Day | Jobs/Hour (Peak) | Will It Work? | What Happens |
|----------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **100** | ~10-20 | ‚úÖ **YES** | Plenty of headroom, jobs process instantly |
| **500** | ~50-100 | ‚úÖ **YES** | Some queueing during peak, but acceptable |
| **1,000** | ~100-200 | ‚ö†Ô∏è **MAYBE** | Significant queueing (5-10min wait times) |
| **5,000** | ~500+ | ‚ùå **NO** | Overwhelmed, 30min+ wait times |

**Current User Base Estimate:**
- You're probably doing **10-100 jobs/day** right now
- This setup will handle **500-1000 jobs/day** comfortably
- You have **months to years** before you need to scale

### When to Worry About Scaling

**Green Light (Don't Change Anything):**
- ‚úÖ < 500 jobs/day
- ‚úÖ Users don't complain about wait times
- ‚úÖ Average queue time < 30 seconds

**Yellow Light (Start Planning):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 500-1000 jobs/day consistently
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Peak hour queueing > 2 minutes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Users mentioning "slow" in feedback

**Red Light (Need to Scale NOW):**
- ‚ùå > 1000 jobs/day
- ‚ùå Queue times > 5 minutes
- ‚ùå Worker crashes/restarts frequently

## üõ£Ô∏è Your Options Going Forward

### Option 1: STAY ON CLOUD RUN AS-IS (RECOMMENDED FOR NOW)

**When to Choose:** You're under 500 jobs/day and want to focus on product, not infrastructure.

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Works perfectly now** (6-second jobs)
- ‚úÖ **Zero additional work** (already done)
- ‚úÖ **Good enough for 6-12 months** (unless you go viral)
- ‚úÖ **Easy monitoring** (Cloud Run dashboard)
- ‚úÖ **Known cost** (~$30/month)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Sequential processing (one job at a time)
- ‚ùå Will need to migrate eventually if you scale
- ‚ùå Polling is inefficient (but works fine at low scale)

**Cost:** $25-35/month (current)

**Migration Effort:** None (already there)

**When to Revisit:** When you hit 500+ jobs/day consistently OR users complain about wait times.

---

### Option 2: MIGRATE TO RAILWAY (GOOD FOR MEDIUM SCALE)

**When to Choose:** You want better performance and simpler pricing NOW, or you're planning for growth.

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Better pricing model** (flat rate, not always-on billing quirks)
- ‚úÖ **Same architecture works** (no code changes needed)
- ‚úÖ **Easy deployment** (Docker-based, like Cloud Run)
- ‚úÖ **Simpler to reason about** (persistent compute, no serverless gotchas)
- ‚úÖ **Can run concurrent jobs** (easier to add parallelism)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå **2-4 hours migration time** (not nothing, but not huge)
- ‚ùå **Smaller ecosystem** than GCP (less monitoring tooling)
- ‚ùå **Different platform** (need to learn Railway quirks)

**Cost:** $15-25/month (cheaper than Cloud Run)

**Migration Effort:** LOW
1. Create Railway account (5 min)
2. Connect GitHub repo (5 min)
3. Configure environment variables (10 min)
4. Deploy (Railway auto-detects Dockerfile) (30 min)
5. Test (30 min)
6. Update frontend API URL (10 min)
7. Monitor for a day (1 day)

**Expected Performance:** Same 6-10s per job (no change, since Cloud Run is fixed now)

**When to Choose:** If you want to "future-proof" for growth OR if you just prefer Railway's simplicity.

---

### Option 3: IMPLEMENT PG-BOSS QUEUE SYSTEM (PROPER SCALING)

**When to Choose:** You're hitting 500-1000+ jobs/day OR need horizontal scaling.

**What This Involves:**

**Phase 1: Add pg-boss (Keep Polling Hybrid)**
```typescript
// services/worker/src/index.ts
import PgBoss from 'pg-boss';

const boss = new PgBoss({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  // Use Supabase pooler connection
});

await boss.start();

// Replace polling with pg-boss.fetch()
setInterval(async () => {
  const jobs = await boss.fetch('generate-job', 5);
  for (const job of jobs) {
    await processJob(job.data);
    await boss.complete(job.id);
  }
}, 5000);
```

**Phase 2: Event-Driven (No Polling)**
```typescript
// Frontend pushes jobs to pg-boss directly
await boss.send('generate-job', jobData);

// Worker listens for jobs (no polling)
await boss.work('generate-job', async (job) => {
  await processJob(job.data);
});
```

**Phase 3: Horizontal Scaling**
- Deploy multiple worker instances
- pg-boss handles job distribution
- Each worker pulls from shared queue

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Proper job queue** (retries, priorities, delays)
- ‚úÖ **Horizontal scaling** (multiple workers)
- ‚úÖ **Better monitoring** (pg-boss dashboard)
- ‚úÖ **Industry standard** (proven pattern)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå **Significant dev work** (1-2 weeks)
- ‚ùå **Complexity increase** (more moving parts)
- ‚ùå **Database load** (pg-boss uses DB for queue)
- ‚ùå **Supabase connection issues** (you already tried this, had problems)

**Cost:** Same as current (~$30/month Cloud Run OR $20/month Railway)

**Migration Effort:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- Phase 1 (Hybrid): 2-4 days development
- Phase 2 (Event-Driven): 3-5 days development
- Phase 3 (Horizontal): 2-3 days development
- **Total:** 1-2 weeks of focused work

**When to Choose:** When you're consistently hitting 500+ jobs/day AND ready to invest in infrastructure.

---

### Option 4: CLOUD TASKS (GOOGLE'S RECOMMENDED APPROACH)

**When to Choose:** You want to stay on GCP AND need proper event-driven architecture.

**What This Involves:**

Replace polling with Cloud Tasks push model:

**Frontend:**
```typescript
// POST /api/jobs
const task = {
  httpRequest: {
    url: 'https://scribblemachine-worker.run.app/process',
    method: 'POST',
    body: Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(jobData)).toString('base64')
  }
};
await tasksClient.createTask({parent: queuePath, task});
```

**Worker:**
```typescript
// Becomes HTTP endpoint (no polling)
app.post('/process', async (req, res) => {
  const job = req.body;
  await processJob(job);
  res.status(200).send('OK'); // Cloud Tasks marks as complete
});
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ **Google's recommended pattern** (first-class support)
- ‚úÖ **No polling** (event-driven)
- ‚úÖ **Auto-scaling** (Cloud Tasks handles queueing)
- ‚úÖ **Retry logic** built-in
- ‚úÖ **Stays on GCP** (no platform migration)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå **Major code rewrite** (frontend + worker)
- ‚ùå **More expensive** (Cloud Tasks + Cloud Run)
- ‚ùå **Added latency** (job ‚Üí Cloud Tasks ‚Üí Cloud Run)
- ‚ùå **More complexity** (additional service)

**Cost:** $35-50/month (Cloud Tasks + Cloud Run)

**Migration Effort:** HIGH (1-2 weeks)

**When to Choose:** If you're committed to GCP long-term AND need horizontal scaling.

## üí° My Specific Recommendation for YOU

### Phase 1: STAY ON CLOUD RUN AS-IS (Next 6-12 Months)

**Why:**
1. **It's fixed and fast** (6-second jobs, 58x improvement)
2. **You're not at scale yet** (probably < 100 jobs/day)
3. **Focus on product** (not infrastructure)
4. **Known costs** (~$30/month)
5. **You have time** (months before scaling becomes an issue)

**Action Items:**
- ‚úÖ **Nothing** (you're done!)
- Monitor usage (jobs/day, queue times)
- Revisit when you hit 500+ jobs/day

---

### Phase 2: WHEN TO SWITCH (6-12 Months from Now)

**Trigger:** You're consistently hitting 500+ jobs/day OR users complain about wait times.

**Best Option at That Point:** Railway OR pg-boss on Cloud Run

**Why Railway:**
- Simpler migration (2-4 hours)
- Better pricing for 24/7 workloads
- Easier to add concurrency (just increase worker count)

**Why pg-boss on Cloud Run:**
- Stays on GCP (if that matters to you)
- Proper queue system (horizontal scaling)
- Industry standard approach

**Decision Criteria:**
- **Choose Railway if:** You value speed/simplicity and don't care about GCP lock-in
- **Choose pg-boss if:** You want proper scaling and are committed to GCP

## üìä Cost Comparison Table

| Solution | Setup Time | Monthly Cost | Scalability | Complexity |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Cloud Run (Current)** | ‚úÖ Done | $25-35 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited (500/day) | Low |
| **Railway** | 2-4 hours | $15-25 | ‚úÖ Good (5000/day) | Low |
| **Cloud Run + pg-boss** | 1-2 weeks | $30-40 | ‚úÖ Great (50K/day) | Medium |
| **Cloud Run + Cloud Tasks** | 1-2 weeks | $35-50 | ‚úÖ Great (50K/day) | High |

## üéØ The Bottom Line

### What We Learned

**The Problem:** Cloud Run's default CPU throttling made your polling worker 58x slower than it should be.

**The Fix:** One command (`--no-cpu-throttling`) solved it completely.

**The Misconception:** We initially thought it was Gemini API latency, resource constraints, or PDF generation. It was actually Cloud Run's billing model throttling CPU during non-HTTP work.

**The Proof:** Standalone test (HTTP request context) was fast. Production worker (no HTTP context) was throttled.

### What You Should Do

**Today:**
1. ‚úÖ **Nothing** (problem is solved)
2. Monitor Cloud Run costs (should be ~$30/month)
3. Focus on your product

**When you hit 500+ jobs/day:**
1. Decide: Railway (simple) OR pg-boss (proper scaling)
2. Allocate 2-4 hours (Railway) OR 1-2 weeks (pg-boss)
3. Migrate

**For now:**
- **You have 6-12 months** before scaling is an issue
- **Your architecture is fine** for current scale
- **Don't prematurely optimize**

### The Architecture Decisions (ADR-001, ADR-002)

**ADR-001: Database Polling vs pg-boss**
- **Decision:** Use simple polling for MVP
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **STILL VALID** (works great with CPU throttling fixed)
- **Revisit:** When you hit 500+ jobs/day

**ADR-002: Simplified Worker Architecture**
- **Decision:** Single worker, sequential processing
- **Status:** ‚úÖ **STILL VALID** (good enough for current scale)
- **Revisit:** When you hit 1000+ jobs/day OR need horizontal scaling

**Technical Debt:** Yes, you'll eventually need proper queue system. But NOT NOW.

## üö® Critical Learnings for Future

### What NOT to Do

1. ‚ùå **Don't use Cloud Run for polling workers without `--no-cpu-throttling`**
2. ‚ùå **Don't assume performance issues are the API** (check infrastructure first)
3. ‚ùå **Don't prematurely optimize** (current setup handles 500/day)
4. ‚ùå **Don't migrate platforms just because** (Cloud Run works fine now)

### What TO Do

1. ‚úÖ **Monitor jobs/day and queue times** (your scaling signals)
2. ‚úÖ **Keep architecture simple** until you NEED complexity
3. ‚úÖ **Test fixes with real workloads** (like we did with job 07d62d9b)
4. ‚úÖ **Document decisions** (this doc is an example)
