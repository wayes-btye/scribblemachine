# MCP Servers Test Report

**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Test Environment**: GitHub Actions (Claude Code)
**Branch**: `claude/issue-5-20251004-1141`

## Executive Summary

This report documents the testing of three MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers: Context7, Playwright, and Shadcn. The tests were conducted to verify proper installation and connectivity in the GitHub Actions environment.

## Test Results

### ❌ MCP Server Availability Status

**Finding**: None of the expected MCP server tools are available in the current Claude Code environment.

**Expected MCP Tools** (from issue requirements):
- `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id`
- `mcp__context7__get-library-docs`
- `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`
- `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot`
- `mcp__shadcn__search_items_in_registries`

**Available Tools** (actual):
- Standard file operations (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep)
- Bash command execution
- GitHub comment updates
- Task management
- Web operations (WebFetch, WebSearch)

### Test 1: Context7 MCP - Next.js 14 App Router Best Practices

**Status**: ❌ Unable to test
**Reason**: MCP server tools not available in current environment

**Attempted**: Look up "Next.js 14 App Router best practices 2025"
**Expected Tool**: `mcp__context7__get-library-docs`
**Result**: Tool not found in available toolset

### Test 2: Playwright MCP - Homepage Screenshot

**Status**: ❌ Unable to test
**Reason**: MCP server tools not available in current environment

**Attempted**:
- Navigate to https://scribblemachineweb.vercel.app
- Take screenshot of homepage

**Expected Tools**:
- `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`
- `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot`

**Result**: Tools not found in available toolset

### Test 3: Shadcn MCP - Button Component Search

**Status**: ❌ Unable to test
**Reason**: MCP server tools not available in current environment

**Attempted**: Search for "button" component in Shadcn registry
**Expected Tool**: `mcp__shadcn__search_items_in_registries`
**Result**: Tool not found in available toolset

## Analysis

### Root Cause
The MCP server tools are not currently available in the Claude Code environment running in GitHub Actions. This could be due to:

1. **Configuration Issue**: MCP servers may not be properly configured in the GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Installation Issue**: MCP packages may not be pre-installed as expected
3. **Permissions Issue**: The workflow may lack permissions to access MCP servers
4. **Environment Mismatch**: MCP servers may be configured for local development but not CI/CD

### Evidence from Repository

Based on the repository's `CLAUDE.md` file, the project mentions MCP server usage:

> ### MCP Server Usage
> The project is configured to work with these MCP servers:
> - **Context7 MCP**: Documentation lookup and API reference checking
> - **Supabase MCP**: Database operations, schema management
> - **ShadCN MCP**: Component library management
> - **Playwright MCP**: Interactive UI testing and workflow validation

However, these servers appear to be configured for local development environments, not necessarily for GitHub Actions CI/CD.

### Recommendations

1. **Verify MCP Server Installation**
   - Check if MCP packages are included in the GitHub Actions workflow
   - Verify the `.github/workflows/` configuration includes MCP server setup

2. **Alternative Testing Approaches**
   - Use WebFetch for documentation lookup (as mentioned in CLAUDE.md)
   - Use standard browser automation tools for screenshot testing
   - Use direct API calls for component registry queries

3. **Update Workflow Configuration**
   - Add MCP server initialization steps to the GitHub Actions workflow
   - Ensure proper environment variables and permissions are set
   - Consider adding MCP server health checks before running tests

4. **Fallback Testing (What We Can Do Now)**
   - ✅ Use `WebFetch` tool to lookup Next.js 14 documentation
   - ✅ Use `WebFetch` tool to verify homepage loads
   - ✅ Use file system tools to verify Shadcn components in codebase

## Next Steps

To properly test MCP servers in GitHub Actions:

1. Review `.github/workflows/` configuration
2. Add MCP server setup/initialization steps if missing
3. Verify MCP package installations in the workflow
4. Re-run tests once MCP servers are properly configured

## Conclusion

**Test Status**: ❌ Failed - MCP servers not accessible
**Reason**: Tools not available in current environment
**Impact**: Cannot verify MCP server functionality in CI/CD
**Action Required**: Update GitHub Actions workflow to include MCP server setup
