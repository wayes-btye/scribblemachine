# Inline MCP Configuration Test Report

## Test Date
2025-10-04T15:10:53Z

## MCP Server Status
| Server | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| context7 | ❌ FAILED | No MCP tools detected for Context7 server |
| playwright | ❌ FAILED | No MCP tools detected for Playwright server |
| shadcn | ❌ FAILED | No MCP tools detected for Shadcn server |
| github_comment | ✅ CONNECTED | Built-in MCP server working correctly |

## Test Results

### Context7 Test
**Query**: Next.js 14 App Router server actions
**Result**: ❌ **UNABLE TO EXECUTE** - Context7 MCP server not connected. No `mcp__context7__*` tools available in the runtime environment.

### Shadcn Test
**Components Found**: ❌ **UNABLE TO EXECUTE** - Shadcn MCP server not connected. No `mcp__shadcn__*` tools available in the runtime environment.

## Conclusion
❌ **FAILED** - The inline MCP configuration is not working as expected. Only 1 out of 4 MCP servers (github_comment) is connected successfully.

### Issue Analysis
The test reveals that while the built-in `github_comment` MCP server works correctly, the three pre-installed MCP servers (Context7, Playwright, Shadcn) are **not being loaded** in the GitHub Actions environment despite the inline `mcp_config` parameter.

**Evidence**:
- Expected: MCP tools prefixed with `mcp__context7__*`, `mcp__playwright__*`, `mcp__shadcn__*`
- Actual: Only `mcp__github_comment__*` tools are available

## Comparison to Test #2
**Previous Test (External .mcp-github.json)**:
- context7: ❌ failed
- playwright: ❌ failed
- shadcn: ❌ failed

**Current Test (Inline mcp_config)**:
- context7: ❌ failed
- playwright: ❌ failed
- shadcn: ❌ failed

### Comparison Result
**NO IMPROVEMENT** - The inline `mcp_config` parameter produces the same failed results as the external `.mcp-github.json` approach. The issue persists regardless of configuration method.

## Recommendation

### Root Cause Investigation Needed
The inline MCP configuration fix (Fix #4, commit cd9f0b8) does not resolve the MCP server loading issue. The problem appears to be deeper than just configuration file precedence.

### Next Steps
1. **Verify GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Check if the workflow file properly passes the `mcp_config` parameter
   - Verify the JSON structure is valid
   - Confirm the action version supports inline MCP config

2. **Check MCP Server Installation**:
   - Verify that Context7, Playwright, and Shadcn MCP servers are actually installed
   - Check if server binaries/packages are accessible in the GitHub Actions environment
   - Review server installation paths and permissions

3. **Enable Debug Logging**:
   - Add debug output to show which MCP servers are being initialized
   - Log the contents of the `mcp_config` parameter
   - Capture any MCP server startup errors

4. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Consider using GitHub Actions environment variables for MCP config
   - Test with a single MCP server first to isolate the issue
   - Review claude-code-action documentation for MCP server setup examples

### Success Criteria Not Met
- ❌ At least 2 out of 3 MCP servers connect successfully (0/3 connected)
- ❌ Context7 MCP returns valid documentation (server not available)
- ❌ Shadcn MCP lists components (server not available)
- ✅ Auto-approve works (no manual intervention needed)
- ✅ Report created successfully

**Overall Test Result**: **3/5 criteria met** - Test automation works, but MCP servers are not connecting.
