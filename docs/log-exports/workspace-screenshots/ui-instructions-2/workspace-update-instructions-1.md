In this folder `docs/log-exports/workspace-screenshots/ui-instructions-2` I have included screenshots of Worktree-1 (`trees/3-redesign-workspace-1`) I created a number of UI designs by a worktree with the AI agent. None of them really fit the exact criteria I'm looking for, however there was some minor parts of this worktree which I liked and I have mentioned it in this prompt as instructions for you. 

You should look at the screenshots of the worktree-1 design and you should also look at some of the screenshots inside the `docs/log-exports/workspace-screenshots` We show some of those steps in particular image 0-2.3.

# Timeline Workspace Steps
- In the worktree design, The top section with "Upload photo", "Create magic", and "Ready to color" steps is clear and effective for the user. The three-dot timeline makes the process intuitive.
    - Suggestion: Make this timeline space slightly smaller than shown in the screenshot, so it’s prominent but not overwhelming. To make that one of the key aspects of the page. Optionally, consider a shrinking effect as the user scrolls.
- Each coloring page generation step should be presented individually to the user and not merged on same UI. For example:
    - When uploading an image, that should be the sole focus.
    - When entering imagine text, that should be the only action available.
    - One thing should be the main focus CTA anything else is very minor in comparison
- I also like the header separation. However, the header might be a bit too big, so think about that. 

# Coloring Configuration Options

- Current configuration options for coloring pages (see `docs/log-exports/workspace-screenshots/ui-instructions-2/worktree-1-screenshot-imagine.png` and `docs/log-exports/workspace-screenshots/2.1_Imagine-idea-selected.png`) are too bulky and require excessive scrolling.
    - Recommendation: Use a more compact selection method, or display these options only after the user presses Enter/Next. Choose whichever approach best improves usability and visibility for the target user.

# Focus Guidance

- For this session, focus on:
    - The timeline feature
    - The initial upload step
    - The initial imagine text box
- Avoid the current two-row layout in production. Instead, centralize the active option (either upload drop zone or imagine text box with suggestions) and set an appropriate width for both, making the interface visually balanced and easy to use.
- Reconsider any steps that currently appear only on the left or right—aim for a more consistent, centralized layout (see screenshots for reference).
- Best practice: Prefer shadcn components. If possible, achieve the desired result by tweaking settings or parameters of existing shadcn components, rather than creating custom components from scratch.
