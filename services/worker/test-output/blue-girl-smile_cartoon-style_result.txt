Response:
Here's a description of a cartoon-style coloring page based on the image provided.  Since I can't create images, I'll give you detailed instructions to create it yourself using drawing software or even hand-drawing:

**Character:**

1. **Head:** Draw a large, slightly oval-shaped head with a thick black outline.
2. **Hair:** Simplify the hair into a slightly wavy bob, using flowing lines.  Keep it relatively simple; you can suggest individual strands with a few lines but avoid intricate detailing.  Add a thick black outline around the hair.
3. **Eyes:** Use large, almond-shaped eyes that are wide open.  Make them simple and friendly-looking; add a thick black outline.
4. **Nose:**  A small, simple triangle or a short curved line will suffice.
5. **Mouth:** Draw a wide, open smile with clearly defined teeth.  Make sure the smile is large and happy, encompassing most of the lower half of the face. Add a thick black outline.
6. **Ears:** Use small, simple oval shapes for the ears.  Add a thick black outline.

**Body:**

1. **Dress:**  A simple, sleeveless dress with a round neckline is ideal.  The dress can be slightly puffed around the shoulders.  Add a thick black outline to the entire dress.
2. **Arms:**  Draw the arms slightly bent behind the back, keeping them relatively simple and short.  Add a thick black outline.
3. **Hands:**  Use small, simplified hand shapes at the ends of the arms.

**Background:**

1.  The background can be left blank to allow creative freedom or a simple rectangle to indicate the pink backdrop.

**Style:**

* **Lines:** All lines should be thick and bold, making it easy for children to color within the boundaries.
* **Simplicity:** Avoid any fine details.  The focus should be on creating a cute and easily colorable image.
* **Expression:** The expression on the girl's face is essential.  It should be joyful and bright.


**Further Fun:**

* You could add simple decorations to the dress, such as polka dots, a simple pattern or flowers.
* Adding speech bubbles with simple words like “Hi!” or “Happy!” would enhance the fun aspect.


Remember to keep the style child-friendly and focus on the overall cuteness and simplicity of the illustration.  This detailed description should enable you to easily create the coloring page.
