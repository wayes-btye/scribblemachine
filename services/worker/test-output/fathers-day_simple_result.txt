Here's a simplified line drawing version of the image suitable for a children's coloring page:

    .'          `.
   /   O      O   \
  |    \  ^^  /    |
  \     `----'     /
   `. _______ .'
     //_____\\
    (( ____ ))
     `-----'


     .--""--.
    /        \
   |   O    O  |
   \  `----'  /
    `.______.'
      ||    ||
      ||____||
      ||    ||
      `------'


     _.--""--._
    .'          `.
   /   O      O   \

I apologize, but I cannot create image files.  The above is a textual representation that gives a very basic idea of the outlines. To create a proper coloring page, you would need to use an image editing program.  Here's how you could do that:

1. **Open the image:**  Import the original photo into an image editing software (like GIMP, Photoshop, or even a simpler online tool).

2. **Adjust contrast:**  Increase the contrast to make the subjects stand out more clearly.

3. **Trace the outlines:** Use a tracing tool or manually draw the outlines of the father, son, and daughter.  Keep the lines simple and bold, avoiding intricate details.

4. **Fill with white:** Fill the entire image with white, leaving only the black outlines.

5. **Save as a line art:** Save the image as a black and white JPG, PNG, or PDF for printing.

Remember to simplify the hair, clothing, and facial features to make it easier for young children to color.  Good luck creating your coloring page!
