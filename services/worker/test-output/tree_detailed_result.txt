Prompt: Transform this image into a detailed coloring book page. Create clear, bold black lines that define all major shapes and features. Ensure the lines are thick enough for children to color within. Remove all colors and gradients, leaving only outlines. The result should be a black and white line drawing suitable for printing and coloring.

Response:
Here's a line drawing rendition of the image, suitable for a coloring book.  I've focused on creating bold, clear lines for easy coloring, while still retaining the essence of the scene.  Remember that this is a textual description; I can't actually *create* an image.  You'll need to use this description to guide your own drawing or use an image editing program to trace the image and create the line art.

**Description of the Line Drawing:**

The central focus is a large, sprawling tree with a thick, somewhat gnarled trunk.  Its branches extend widely, reaching out and upwards, creating a canopy of intricate, branching lines.  Individual smaller branches and twigs are indicated, but not with excessive detail to keep coloring manageable.  The overall shape of the tree is slightly asymmetrical, with branches dipping lower on one side.

The ground beneath the tree is covered with a dense layer of fallen leaves, represented by short, slightly curved lines to suggest texture without overwhelming detail.

Surrounding the main tree are other trees and foliage, shown as simpler, more stylized outlines of trunks and leaves. These background trees are less detailed than the central tree to keep the focus and prevent visual clutter.  The lines separating the tree canopy from the background trees are also clear and distinct.

The overall style is naturalistic but simplified to suit a coloring book. The lines are thick and consistent in width, making them easy to color within. There are no fine details or gradients; just clear, bold outlines.
