Prompt: Transform this image into a detailed coloring book page. Create clear, bold black lines that define all major shapes and features. Ensure the lines are thick enough for children to color within. Remove all colors and gradients, leaving only outlines. The result should be a black and white line drawing suitable for printing and coloring.

Response:
Here's a line drawing version of the teddy bear image, suitable for a coloring book page.  I've focused on clear, bold lines and simplified some details for easier coloring.

(Please note: I can't actually *create* an image file here. I'm providing a description to guide you or an artist in creating the coloring page.  You'll need to use drawing software or draw it by hand.)


**Description of the Line Drawing:**

* **The Bear:** The bear's body is outlined with thick, solid lines defining its large, round shape.  The arms and legs are similarly outlined, showing the stitching details as simplified, parallel lines. The paws are clearly delineated with distinct toes.  The face includes separate outlines for the eyes, nose, and mouth. The nose is a simple, rounded shape.  The ears are slightly rounded and attached to the head.  The texture of the fur is simplified, without trying to represent individual threads.

* **The Clothing:** The hoodie is shown with a distinct outline, showing the hood's shape draped over the bear's head and the edges. The zipper of the jacket is a series of parallel lines down the front.  The sleeve and body seams of the jacket are also shown with thicker lines.  The text and logo on the jacket are simplified to basic shapes or omitted entirely for easier coloring.

* **Line Weight:** The line weight throughout should be consistently thick (approximately 2-3mm when printed at a typical coloring book size). This ensures that children can easily stay within the lines while coloring.


**Steps to Create the Coloring Page (using drawing software):**

1. **Import the Image:** Import the original photo into your drawing software.
2. **Create a New Layer:** Create a new layer on top of the photo layer to avoid altering the original.
3. **Outline Major Shapes:** Use a thick black brush tool to carefully trace the main outlines of the teddy bear and its clothing. Don't worry about small details at this stage.
4. **Refine Outlines:** Once the major shapes are outlined, refine the lines, making them smooth and consistent.
5. **Simplify Details:** Simplify details like fur texture and embroidered logo.
6. **Clean Up:** Erase any stray lines or imperfections.
7. **Export:** Export the image as a high-resolution PNG or JPG file for printing.


This detailed description should allow you to create a coloring page that is both visually appealing and easy for children to use. Remember to prioritize clear, bold lines over intricate details.
