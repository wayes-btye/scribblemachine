Prompt: Transform this image into a detailed coloring book page. Create clear, bold black lines that define all major shapes and features. Ensure the lines are thick enough for children to color within. Remove all colors and gradients, leaving only outlines. The result should be a black and white line drawing suitable for printing and coloring.

Response:
Here's a line drawing of the Volkswagen Golf R, suitable for a coloring book page.  I've focused on creating thick, clear lines for easy coloring.  Some details might be slightly simplified for better clarity for children.

(Please note: I can't actually *create* an image here. I'm a text-based AI.  To get the image, you'd need to use this description with an image editing software or a website that can create line art from photos. Many free online tools exist for this.)


**Description for Line Art Creation:**

The image should be a top-down view of a Volkswagen Golf R.  The lines should be thick and bold (at least 3-5 pixels wide).

* **Car Body:**  The main body shape should be clearly defined, with separate lines for the hood, roof, windows, doors, and fenders.  The slight curve of the body should be shown, not just a boxy shape. The front and rear bumpers should be distinct shapes with their own thick lines outlining their features.
* **Wheels and Tires:** The wheels should have clearly defined spokes. The tires should be distinct from the wheel rims.  The tires should also be circular.
* **Headlights and Taillights:**  The headlights and taillights need to be outlined, with the internal details (such as the individual lights) simplified to avoid overly intricate coloring.
* **Grill and Badge:** The grill should be defined, with a simple representation of the Volkswagen badge.
* **License Plate:** The license plate area should be clearly outlined as a rectangle with the numbers inside (no need for fine lines for individual numbers).
* **Mirrors:** The side mirrors are simple, slightly triangular shapes, outlined clearly.
* **Window Details:** The windows have simple, straight lines. The black roof section should be clearly separated.
* **Ground:**  A simple suggestion of the ground beneath the car is sufficient, perhaps with some very basic texturing to indicate gravel.  Avoid complicated background details.


Remember to keep the lines clean, and the overall style should be simple enough for children to easily color within the lines.  Avoid overly detailed elements.
