Prompt: Convert this image into a simple coloring page for children. Create clean black outlines on a white background. Remove all colors, shading, and textures. Make it suitable for kids ages 4-8 to color in.

Response:
Here's a line drawing of the teddy bear, suitable for a children's coloring page.  I've simplified the details to make it easier for children aged 4-8 to color:

```
     /\
    /  \

```

This is a textual representation, and a visual representation would be preferable.  To get a proper coloring page image, you would need to use image editing software to create a vector graphic or a high-resolution raster image based on a simplified version of the teddy bear's outline. The provided text is just an extremely simplified representation and cannot be used directly to generate a coloring page.  The detail in the original image is too complex for a simple line drawing suitable for young children.  A professional vector graphics editor would be needed to accurately reproduce the simplified bear in an appropriate style for coloring.
