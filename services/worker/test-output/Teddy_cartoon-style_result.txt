Here's a description of a cartoon-style coloring page based on the provided image of a teddy bear.  Since I can't create images directly, I'll give you instructions that you can follow to create your own coloring page using drawing software or by hand:

**The Teddy Bear Coloring Page:**

1. **Body:** Draw a large, simplified oval for the bear's body. Add two smaller, slightly overlapping ovals for the legs, connected to the main body oval.  Make the outlines very thick and bold.

2. **Head:** Draw a circle for the head, connected to the body oval. Add two smaller, rounded shapes for the ears on top of the head circle.

3. **Face:** Within the head circle, draw two large, simple circles for eyes. Below them, draw a small oval for the nose, and a slightly curved line for the mouth.  Make the nose black.

4. **Hat:** Draw a slightly curved trapezoid shape on top of the bear’s head representing the hat.  Add a small curved line on the top of the hat to suggest a fold.

5. **Jacket:** Draw a simplified jacket over the bear’s body.  Use two large, curved rectangles to indicate the sleeves,  and one larger rectangle for the body of the jacket. Add a simple zipper line down the center of the jacket and two thinner, horizontal stripes near the hem of the jacket.

6. **Feet:**  Draw simple oval shapes at the end of each leg. Add the word "Dad" on one foot in simple block letters.

7. **Details:**  Avoid any intricate details of the original image. Keep everything simple and child-friendly. The goal is easy coloring, not complex patterns.

**Colors to suggest:**

* **Body:** Gray
* **Hat:** Red
* **Jacket:** Dark Blue, Light Blue (for the stripes)
* **Eyes:** Black
* **Nose:** Black
* **Mouth:** Black (or leave it uncolored)

**Important Notes for the Coloring Page:**

* **Large Shapes:**  Use large, easy-to-color shapes.
* **Thick Outlines:** Make the outlines significantly thick (approximately 1/8 inch or more if you are drawing by hand). This will make it easy for young children to stay within the lines and for their coloring to be contained.
* **Simple Details:**  Avoid small or complex shapes.
* **Fun and Engaging:** The design should look fun and welcoming to children.


Remember to use your creativity and adjust the details slightly if needed to make it unique and visually appealing! This detailed description should help you create a fantastic teddy bear coloring page.
