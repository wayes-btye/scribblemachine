Prompt: Convert this image into a simple coloring page for children. Create clean black outlines on a white background. Remove all colors, shading, and textures. Make it suitable for kids ages 4-8 to color in.

Response:
Here's a simplified line drawing of the girl, suitable for a coloring page for children aged 4-8.  I've kept the lines simple and avoided intricate details.

```
     _.--""--._
    .'          `.
   /   O      O   \
  |    \  ^^  /    |
  \     `----'     /
   `. _______ .'
     //_____\\
    (( ____ ))
     `-----'
       ||
       ||
      /__\
     |    |
     |____|
    /      \
   /________\
  /__________\

**Note:**  This is a text-based representation. To create a proper coloring page, you would need to use an image editing program to create a more detailed and accurate line art drawing based on this simplified version and the original image.  The text version is only a guide to the simplicity needed for the line art.  The details of the hair and dress would need to be significantly simplified in a real image to make it suitable for a 4-8 year old.
